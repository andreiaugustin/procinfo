# procinfo

Omnis Studio API library exposing processes currently running on the system

## How to build

From Omnis Studio, use the `Create project library from JSON` from Project Libraries, in the Studio Browser, to import this library.

## How to use

The library is designed to be exported through an API object. Use `$root.$modes.$getapiobject('procinfo')` to obtain a new object reference of the APIs this library exports.

## Available APIs

**NOTE: Currently these APIs are only available on macOS. They will be available for other platforms soon.**

`$getProcessesList(pErrorText)` returns a list of processes running on your system generated by `ps aux`, therefore it contains the user who started the process, the PID, %CPU and %MEM usage at the time when the sample was taken, the command used to start the process and more.
